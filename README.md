  - Also the Virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates.
  - Protect the infrastruture that runs all of the services offered in the AWS cloud: hardware, software, networking and facilities.
* The customer (Security in the Cloud):
  - Security and management of the guest OS (including updates and patches).
  - Other associated application software.
  - Configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall.
  - It depends on the AWS Cloud services the customer selects from the AWS offering.
